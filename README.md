# Forex-Scraping

This program was intended to explore and experiment with Github actions. This program scrapes a webpage for information about Forex performance. It uses Github actions to automatically scrape that information and generate a static webpage and display it into a table. This done using two python scripts as well as the curl command to obtain the webpage itself. I have currently disabled actions for this repository so that the I can keep the number of commits low. But if the actions are enabled, the script will run 6, 26 and 46 minutes pass every hour.
